    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In my last post <a href="http://seancdougherty.com/blog/2016/10/02/i-suck-at-git/">I Suck at Git</a> I mentioned that I&rsquo;d post some other git-gotchas in the future. I love this workflow, courtesy of Colin, my goto for all things git.</p>

<p>Have you ever made changes to files in an existing git project, committed them, and realized you intended to commit the changes to a different branch?</p>

<h3>I have</h3>

<p>Here is the scenario. At Ello, we use a simple branching model. You&rsquo;re probably familar with it. <code>master</code> is kept clean, ideally only production ready code sees the light of <code>master</code>. When working on bug fixes or features we create topic or feature branches. A typical flow starts with a fresh pull from master.</p>

<p><code>
git co master
git pull
</code></p>

<p>Followed by creating a feature branch.</p>

<p><code>
git co -b sd/feature/make-america-great-again
</code></p>

<p>Next, all the code that Makes America Great Again is written, the tests are written, they&rsquo;re submitted as a pull-request, reviewed, updated, and finally submitted for acceptance testing, approved and merged.</p>

<p>This is the typical flow. It works great. Most of the time.</p>

<p>But what if someone (finger pointed at myself) gets a little ahead of himself and forgets to create a topic/feature branch? What if they write some <em>tremendous</em> code and immediately commit it directly to master?</p>

<p><code>
git co master
git pull
... write some tremendous code
git add ... tremendous code
git commit -m "adds tremendous code"
... write more amazing code
git add ... amazing code
git commit -m "adds amazing code"
</code></p>

<p>After realizing that there are two commits in master that I intended to commit to <code>sd/feature/make-america-great-again</code> I need to fix things. It turns out that the fix is pretty simple. There are several approaches to the problem but I really like this one.</p>

<ol>
<li>create a new branch</li>
<li>checkout master</li>
<li><code>git reset HEAD~</code> the requisite number of times</li>
<li>move on with your life</li>
</ol>


<p>After executing the offending commits.</p>

<p><code>
git co -b sd/feature/make-america-great-again
git co master
git reset HEAD~ // undoes the most recent commit, leaving the modified changes on disk
git reset HEAD~ // undoes the next commit, leaving the modified changes on disk
... do what you want, git stash is a reasonable idea
git co sd/feature/make-america-great-again // now you have the commits on the originally intended branch
</code></p>

<p>Crisis overted. Thats pretty much it. You&rsquo;re now in the position you inteded to be in the first place. Working on a feature branch, having commited a couple of changes. No harm, no foul.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>No really, I <strong><em>suck</em></strong> at git.</h2>

<h4>Give me too much rope and, well, you know&hellip;</h4>

<p>The other day, at work, I got myself into GIT trouble. This happens once or twice a year. I&rsquo;ll get clever, attempt something above my git pay grade, foul things up royally, and eventually call in an expert. Often times this is Jay. In this case it was my co-worker Colin.</p>

<h4>What did my git fat fingers screw up?</h4>

<p>I&rsquo;m so glad you asked. Apple recently released Xcode 8. A requirement of using Swift and Xcode 8 (out of the box) is that your code must be Swift 2.3 or Swift 3.0. Up until the move to Xcode 8 Ello&rsquo;s iOS codebase was written in the production version of Swift, 2.2. Like a good git citizen, I created a topic branch from <code>master</code> named <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code>. Brilliant. No problems yet.</p>

<p>The conversion of over 50k lines of Swift 2.2 to Swift 2.3 ended up being a bigger task than originally planned. Not entirely surprising but we had other &ldquo;real&rdquo; work to do. We decided to branch off of <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> for all feature work happening at the same time. For example, when adding <strong>Awesome Widget</strong> we&rsquo;d simply <code>git co sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> followed with <code>git co -b sd/feature/awesome-widget</code>.</p>

<h4>No big deal</h4>

<p>During the conversion process we needed to push a hot fix for a bug found on a version of the app that was based off of the Swift 2.2 <code>master</code> branch. We made the change, submitted a build to the AppStore and continued working on Swift 2.3 features.</p>

<h4>Horror</h4>

<p>The problem came when I decided to rebase <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> onto <code>master</code>. Bad Sean. I&rsquo;ve been told by many people, Colin included, that I should not be rebasing. Ever. I like rebasing because I want my commits to come after all the vetted commits in <code>master</code>.</p>

<p>Folks like Colin say that rebasing is not in the spirit of git. I&rsquo;m pretty sure he sent me a Linus Torvalds rant echoing the same. Spirit schmirit. Another argument for not rebasing anything public, and the one that actually matters to me, is that it can create an ungodly mess. I now agree with this wholeheartedly.</p>

<h4>Back to my blunder</h4>

<p>The negative effects of my rebasing <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> onto <code>master</code> were not immediately apparent. We eventually merged several pull requests into <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> and planned to distribute an internal TestFlight build of the app. Before I sent it live Colin messaged me in Slack.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/colin-git.jpg" alt="Missing Commits" /></p>

<h4>Uh oh</h4>

<p>I hadn&rsquo;t even noticed.</p>

<p>The issue ended up being (we think) that Github&rsquo;s pull requests (a GitHub feature, not a git feature) lock the base branch to merge into directly to an individual commit, not to the branch. Rebasing <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> onto <code>master</code> does not change the commit that <code>My Awesome Pull Request</code> will be merged into if the pull request was created prior to the rebase. This should have been obvious but it wasn&rsquo;t. The pull request merge will continue to be merged into the original commit associated with the base branch, <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> in this case. It will not be merged into the completely rewritten commit history of <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> as it exists after the rebase. It gets merged into a commit that is no longer relevant to the rebased branch. This effectively orphans the merge.</p>

<h3>Moral of the story</h3>

<p>Don&rsquo;t rebase anything other people are working with. Especially don&rsquo;t rebase a branch that has other un-merged branches off of it. You&rsquo;ll feel stupid and make a ton of extra work for yourself, or for Colin since he is the one who will inevitably end up fixing it for you when you stare at your screen in horror.</p>

<h3>How to fix it?</h3>

<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-cherry-pick"><code>git cherry-pick</code></a> is your friend here. We ended up identifying each missing commit and cherry picked them (in original order) into a new branch created from <code>master</code> which had the merged <code>sd/swift-2-dot-3</code> code. Then we submitted a new <a href="https://github.com/ello/ello-ios/pull/156">pull request</a> for all of the open-source world to see :).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve fought Colin on the whole &ldquo;rebase vs merge&rdquo; debate for a long time. I took my licks on this one. I have a few other git-gotchas to talk about in the future. Believe it or not, this is not my first (or last) time sucking at git.</p>
